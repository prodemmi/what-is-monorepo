# npm/Yarn Workspaces
- Yarn Workspaces is a feature of the Yarn package manager, designed to simplify the development workflow for monorepositories.
- It allows you to hoist dependencies to the root and share them across packages, reducing duplicate dependencies.
- Yarn Workspaces lets you manage and install dependencies at the root level while ensuring that packages can access them.
- It also enables you to run scripts across all workspaces.
